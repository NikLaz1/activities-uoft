# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation.

Your task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible. An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule:

> Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
1) GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards (SEO Optimization 10 rules site*)
WHEN I view the source code
2) THEN I find semantic HTML elements (Update Page to give meaning to each element that needs it (ie h1 class ="logo"))
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
3) THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning (Making sure Html is structured and descriptive)
WHEN I view the image elements
4) THEN I find accessible alt attributes (Going through all img's and addin alt attributes)
WHEN I view the heading attributes
5) THEN they fall in sequential order 
WHEN I view the title element
